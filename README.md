# The-Login-Sign-up-Form
A simple Login Form application built with React. This project offers two options: Login and Sign Up.

Login: Users can log in by providing their email and password.
Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing email, password, and confirm password for verification.
This project demonstrates handling form validation, state management, and basic user authentication logic using React. The form inputs are validated, ensuring that passwords match during the signup process. It is a great starting point for learning form handling and state management in React.
